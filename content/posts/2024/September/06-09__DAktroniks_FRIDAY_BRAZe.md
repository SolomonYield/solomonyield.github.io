### Fed Signals Potential Rate Cut

Federal Reserve Bank of New York President **John Williams** has indicated that it may now be appropriate for the Fed to **reduce interest rates**. In a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, Williams stated that the Fed has made **“significant progress”** toward its goals of maintaining stable prices and maximum employment.

> "With the economy now in equipoise and inflation on a path to 2%, it is now appropriate to dial down the degree of restrictiveness in the stance of policy by reducing the target range for the federal funds rate," Williams said ([Bloomberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_MFzQaVo3c)).

This suggests that the likelihood of a **rate cut on September 17th** is higher than previously expected, which could lead to a **market correction** over the weekend and into next week.

### US Unemployment & Earnings

The US **unemployment rate** for this month is **4.2%** (down from last month’s 4.3%), as anticipated. Additionally, **average hourly earnings** increased by **0.4%** (exceeding forecasts of 0.3%), signaling that **short-term economic conditions** are stable and under control.

Next week, we could potentially see a **2-3% rise in the US stock market**, particularly in the **S&P 500**, which may be followed by a broader global market recovery. **Diligent Yield** suggests that investing in the stock market now is a good opportunity, especially with many stocks trading at a discount following the **NVIDIA 20% drop**.
